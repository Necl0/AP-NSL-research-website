    <h2>History of Socialism in America</h2>
    <p>Socialism in America traces its roots to Robert Owen, a rich manufacturer from Wales, who addressed joint Congress sessions twice arguing for a “New System of Society” in which society would prioritizes kindness and equality over profit chasing, which also meant reinventing society to have the public control assets instead of privatized corporations. Owen argued that the current capitalistic society was inhumane and selfish because it inherently required exploitation to progress in society. Surprisingly, the legislators in attendance were very interested and paid several visits to him to hear his ideas, however, no socialist policies were enacted and the idea didn’t gain much traction. Even in the early 1900s, in Oklahoma, socialism achieved decent support. In 1912, ~1/6th of Oklahoma voters voted for Eugene Debs, a member of the Socialist party. Their reason for support was simple - poor farmers wanted cheaper land and less taxes. Another interesting fact to note is that almost all those socialists were devout Christians who viewed Jesus’ teachings as socialist in nature. Around this time, socialists were among the leading figures in enacting social change; they rallied support for women’s suffrage, medicare, the minimum wage, workplace safety laws, universal health insurance, and civil rights for all. Additionally, the socialist mantra of limiting the power of big business was overwhelmingly supported by the general populace. During the Cold War era, the American government actively fought against socialism, which was seen as a threat to national security and democracy. This led to the persecution of socialist activists, including the infamous Red Scare, which saw many socialists and leftists falsely accused of being communist sympathizers. However, despite this repression, the socialist movement continued to grow and evolve throughout the 20th century, particularly during times of economic hardship such as the Great Depression. In recent years, the popularity of socialist ideas has surged, particularly among younger generations. This is often attributed to growing income inequality, the high cost of healthcare and education, and the ongoing environmental crisis. Socialism is increasingly seen as a viable alternative to capitalism, which many view as inherently exploitative and unsustainable. While socialism still faces significant opposition in some circles, particularly among conservative politicians and media outlets, it has become an increasingly influential force in American politics and society.

        <td>Lack of incentives; increasing progressive taxes demotivates people striving for wealth and success

            Evidence: “The basic problem of socialism is the imbalance or asymmetry it creates between costs and benefits. At times the costs are diffused throughout the entire community while the benefits are concentrated on one or a few members. At other times it is the costs that are concentrated while the benefits are diffused. The result is that socialism, by its very nature, rewards sloth and indolence and penalizes diligence and hard work.” (Osterfeld)

      <tr class="cons">
        <td>Powerful labor unions can cause labor market antagonism by promoting an “us vs. them” mentality between workers and owners (when they clash over benefits, pay, etc.)

            Evidence: “Unions are monopoly institutions that raise wages through collective bargaining, not productivity improvements. The ensuing higher labor costs, higher costs of negotiating collective bargaining agreements, and higher labor market uncertainty all undercut the gains to union workers just as they magnify losses to nonunion employers, as well as to the shareholders, suppliers, and customers of these unionized firms. They also increase the risk of market disruption from strikes, lockouts, or firm bankruptcies whenever unions or employers overplay their hands in negotiation. These net losses in capital values reduce the pension fund values of unionized and nonunionized workers alike.” (Epstein)

        <td>Health care is rationed which leads to longer waiting lists for care as opposed to a private system as well as placing more financial burden on doctors

            Evidence: “If coverage was nearly universal, cost sharing was very limited, and the payment rates were reduced compared with current law, the demand for medical care would probably exceed the supply of care – with increased wait times for appointments or elective surgeries, greater wait times at doctors’ offices and other medical facilities, or the need to travel greater distances to receive medical care.  Some demand for care might be unmet … Without sufficient investment over the long term, wait times could lengthen as providers’ costs rise with other costs in the economy and the population grows.” (Congressional Budget Office)
            
            </td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="cons">
        <td>Can be very difficult to remove government subsidies and benefits once they’re given

            Evidence: “Milton Friedman argued that “nothing was so permanent as a temporary government subsidy”. A good example is farming subsidies. In the late 1920s and 1930s, US agriculture was in crisis so the Federal government agreed to give temporary support. However, over the years, government subsidies to farming in the US has continued to grow. In 2019, US farmers got a record $22.4 bn in subsidies (NPR) Farming subsidies are not really seen as ‘socialism’ but it is a form of big government intervention giving money to a certain group.” (Pettinger)
