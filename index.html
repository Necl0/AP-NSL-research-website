    <h2>History of Socialism in America</h2>

    <h3 class="period-title">1700s to 1920</h3>
    <p class="period-description">Socialism in America traces its roots to Robert Owen, a rich manufacturer from Wales, who addressed joint Congress sessions twice arguing for a “New System of Society” in which society would prioritizes kindness and equality over profit chasing, which also meant reinventing society to have the public control assets instead of privatized corporations.
        Owen argued that the current capitalistic society was inhumane and selfish because it inherently required exploitation to progress in society.<br><br>
         Surprisingly, the legislators in attendance were very interested and paid several visits to him to hear his ideas, however, no socialist policies were enacted and the
          idea didn’t gain much traction. </p>
    <p class="period-description">In the early 1900s, socialism gained decent support in Oklahoma, with around 1/6th of the voters supporting Eugene Debs, a Socialist party member. Notably, many socialists of that time were devout Christians who considered Jesus' teachings to be socialist in nature. Socialists played a significant role in advocating for social change, such as women's suffrage, workplace safety laws, and child labor regulations.</p>

    <h3 class="period-title">1920 to 2010</h3>
    <p class="period-description">During the period from 1920 to 1990, socialism in America faced significant challenges.
         The early 1920s saw a decline in socialist influence due to the Red Scare and anti-communist sentiment prevalent during the Cold War era.
          Socialist parties and movements faced repression and marginalization, leading to a decline in their political clout. <br><br>
          However, socialist ideas continued to find resonance among certain segments of society, and socialist activists and organizations played a crucial role in advocating for workers' rights and social justice issues. 
          The civil rights movement and the fight against racial inequality in the 1960s and 1970s also saw the teaming up (so to speak) of socialist and civil rights activists, further highlighting the interplay between socialism and social justice.
           While socialism faced challenges and opposition during this period, 
        it remained an important ideological force that influenced progressive movements and contributed to the ongoing struggle for economic and social equality in America.</p>
    <h3 class="period-title">1990s to 2023</h3>
    <p class="period-description">Socialism experienced a resurgence in the late 20th century, with the formation of democratic socialist organizations and the election of socialist politicians at the local and national levels. Bernie Sanders, a self-proclaimed democratic socialist, garnered significant support in the 2016 and 2020 Democratic presidential primary elections, bringing socialist ideas into the mainstream political discourse.</p>
    <p class="period-description">In recent years, the popularity of socialist ideas has surged, particularly among younger generations.
        This is often attributed to growing income inequality, the high cost of healthcare and education, and the ongoing environmental crisis. 
          Socialism is increasingly seen as a viable alternative to capitalism, which many view as inherently exploitative and unsustainable. 
          While socialism still faces significant opposition in some circles, particularly among conservative politicians and media outlets,
           it has become an increasingly influential force in American politics and society.</p>
           <p class="period-description">However, socialism remains a highly polarizing topic, with strong opposition from conservatives and capitalists who argue against its potential economic and individual freedom implications. The future of socialism in America is uncertain, but its influence and relevance in political discussions are likely to persist.</p>

               <td>Lack of incentives; increasing progressive taxes demotivates people striving for wealth and success
       
                   Evidence: “The basic problem of socialism is the imbalance or asymmetry it creates between costs and benefits. At times the costs are diffused throughout the entire community while the benefits are concentrated on one or a few members. At other times it is the costs that are concentrated while the benefits are diffused. The result is that socialism, by its very nature, rewards sloth and indolence and penalizes diligence and hard work.” (Osterfeld)

               <td>Powerful labor unions can cause labor market antagonism by promoting an “us vs. them” mentality between workers and owners (when they clash over benefits, pay, etc.)
       
                   Evidence: “Unions are monopoly institutions that raise wages through collective bargaining, not productivity improvements. The ensuing higher labor costs, higher costs of negotiating collective bargaining agreements, and higher labor market uncertainty all undercut the gains to union workers just as they magnify losses to nonunion employers, as well as to the shareholders, suppliers, and customers of these unionized firms. They also increase the risk of market disruption from strikes, lockouts, or firm bankruptcies whenever unions or employers overplay their hands in negotiation. These net losses in capital values reduce the pension fund values of unionized and nonunionized workers alike.” (Epstein)

               <td>Health care is rationed which leads to longer waiting lists for care as opposed to a private system as well as placing more financial burden on doctors
       
                   Evidence: “If coverage was nearly universal, cost sharing was very limited, and the payment rates were reduced compared with current law, the demand for medical care would probably exceed the supply of care – with increased wait times for appointments or elective surgeries, greater wait times at doctors’ offices and other medical facilities, or the need to travel greater distances to receive medical care.  Some demand for care might be unmet … Without sufficient investment over the long term, wait times could lengthen as providers’ costs rise with other costs in the economy and the population grows.” (Congressional Budget Office)

             <tr class="cons">
               <td>Can be very difficult to remove government subsidies and benefits once they’re given
       
                   Evidence: “Milton Friedman argued that “nothing was so permanent as a temporary government subsidy”. A good example is farming subsidies. In the late 1920s and 1930s, US agriculture was in crisis so the Federal government agreed to give temporary support. However, over the years, government subsidies to farming in the US has continued to grow. In 2019, US farmers got a record $22.4 bn in subsidies (NPR) Farming subsidies are not really seen as ‘socialism’ but it is a form of big government intervention giving money to a certain group.” (Pettinger)
