    <h2>History of Socialism in America</h2>

    <h3 class="period-title">1700s to 1920</h3>
    <p class="period-description">Socialism in America traces its roots to Robert Owen, a rich manufacturer from Wales, who addressed joint Congress sessions twice arguing for a “New System of Society” in which society would prioritizes kindness and equality over profit chasing, which also meant reinventing society to have the public control assets instead of privatized corporations.
        Owen argued that the current capitalistic society was inhumane and selfish because it inherently required exploitation to progress in society.<br><br>
         Surprisingly, the legislators in attendance were very interested and paid several visits to him to hear his ideas, however, no socialist policies were enacted and the
          idea didn’t gain much traction. </p>
    <p class="period-description">In the early 1900s, socialism gained decent support in Oklahoma, with around 1/6th of the voters supporting Eugene Debs, a Socialist party member. Notably, many socialists of that time were devout Christians who considered Jesus' teachings to be socialist in nature. Socialists played a significant role in advocating for social change, such as women's suffrage, workplace safety laws, and child labor regulations.</p>

    <h3 class="period-title">1920 to 2010</h3>
    <p class="period-description">During the period from 1920 to 1990, socialism in America faced significant challenges.
         The early 1920s saw a decline in socialist influence due to the Red Scare and anti-communist sentiment prevalent during the Cold War era.
          Socialist parties and movements faced repression and marginalization, leading to a decline in their political clout. <br><br>
          However, socialist ideas continued to find resonance among certain segments of society, and socialist activists and organizations played a crucial role in advocating for workers' rights and social justice issues. 
          The civil rights movement and the fight against racial inequality in the 1960s and 1970s also saw the teaming up (so to speak) of socialist and civil rights activists, further highlighting the interplay between socialism and social justice.
           While socialism faced challenges and opposition during this period, 
        it remained an important ideological force that influenced progressive movements and contributed to the ongoing struggle for economic and social equality in America.</p>
    <h3 class="period-title">1990s to 2023</h3>
    <p class="period-description">Socialism experienced a resurgence in the late 20th century, with the formation of democratic socialist organizations and the election of socialist politicians at the local and national levels. Bernie Sanders, a self-proclaimed democratic socialist, garnered significant support in the 2016 and 2020 Democratic presidential primary elections, bringing socialist ideas into the mainstream political discourse.</p>
    <p class="period-description">In recent years, the popularity of socialist ideas has surged, particularly among younger generations.
        This is often attributed to growing income inequality, the high cost of healthcare and education, and the ongoing environmental crisis. 
          Socialism is increasingly seen as a viable alternative to capitalism, which many view as inherently exploitative and unsustainable. 
          While socialism still faces significant opposition in some circles, particularly among conservative politicians and media outlets,
           it has become an increasingly influential force in American politics and society.</p>
           <p class="period-description">However, socialism remains a highly polarizing topic, with strong opposition from conservatives and capitalists who argue against its potential economic and individual freedom implications. The future of socialism in America is uncertain, but its influence and relevance in political discussions are likely to persist.</p>

                Socialist policies help regulate the free market; they also reduce monopolies and poverty. 

Reasoning:
The wealthy can still afford most of the things they want even with a high tax rate, and a low tax rate on lower-income families would greatly reduce poverty and homelessness. This makes it so that “economic inequity is reduced, along with economic insecurity.” makes it easier for the common citizen and working class to become just as successful.

               <td>
                Socialism is much better for protecting citizens equally in terms of assets and market shares, and also stabilizes the economy.

Reasoning:
A capitalist economy is notorious for being unstable and volatile due to the market almost being completely dependent on corporations and independent businesses; under a socialist system, the market is dependent on government planning and therefore is less prone to the constant “unfair and exploitative concentrations of wealth and power” of capitalism (Ball).

                Already several successful socialist policies in US (social security, minimum wage, medicare)

               Reasoning:
               Policies like federal minimum wage and social security are some examples of socialist policies that are greatly beneficial to citizens in the US, so there is credible evidence that a socialist economy is safer and more supportive towards members of society. For example, “progressive taxes can be used to reduce income gaps between the richest and poorest (Goodman).” The US already makes use of a progressive tax system, and it puts considerably less financial strain on the less wealthy.

                Socialism could improve the capitalist system in the US and be more generous towards the less wealthy instead of inflating the wealth of the elite class

Reasoning:
In a socialist system, “each person has the same right to access health care and other important social aspects,” creating more equal opportunity for members to contribute to society and less worrying about affording basic necessities (CFI).

               <td>Lack of incentives; increasing progressive taxes demotivates people striving for wealth and success

                Evidence:  As Osterfeld argues, “The basic problem of socialism is the imbalance or asymmetry it creates between costs and benefits”, which references how socialism strives to fund extremely high priced government programs yet provides little benefit to the general populace as opposed to far cheaper capitalist alternatives.

                Evidence: Epstein points out that “Unions are monopoly institutions that raise wages through collective bargaining, not productivity improvements.” which leads to market antagonism. (Epstein)

               <td>Health care is rationed which leads to longer waiting lists for care as opposed to a private system as well as placing more financial burden on doctors

                Evidence: As the Congressional Budget Office notes, socialist universal healthcare leads to “providers’ costs rise with other costs in the economy and the population grows.” If  healthcare would be government funded, cost sharing was very limited, payment would be reduced, and medical care demand would outweigh supply. This would cause the aforementioned increase in providers’ costs and wait times.

               <td>Can be very difficult to remove government subsidies and benefits once they’re given

                Evidence: Milton Friedman argued against subsidies such as the current situation: “ over the years, government subsidies to farming in the US have continued to grow.”, eventually reaching an exorbitant $22.4 billion dollars, which is way more than originally intended by the government when handing out the subsidies in the 1920s ($9 billion).
